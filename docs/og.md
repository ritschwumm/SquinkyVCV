# Organ-3

Organ-3 is a polyphonic "Organ" module based on the Hammond tonew-heel organs. Most of the features are features available on Hammond organs, we have added a couple features of our own.

Organ-3 is by no means super close emulation of a real Hammond. There is no attempt to model imperfections in the tone-wheel teeth, the slightly out of tune scale, exact key click, and such. But the sound is definitely similar to a Hammond.

For those not familiar with old organs, you can think of Organ-3 as a polyphonic synth voice that uses additive synthesis. But the tuning of the partials is constrained to an approximation of the Hammond tuning, and the envelopes are usually fast attack, fast release, full sustain. Internally Organ-3 has 144 sine-wave VCOs and 32 ADRSs.

It's easy to get started. Patch a polyphonic pitch CV to the V/Oct input, patch an appropriate gate to the gate in, and try playing some of the presets available on the context menu.

Like a real organ, Organ-3 sounds really good when processed by a "Leslie" effect. The Surge Rotary is a very good one, although there are probably others.

## Organ basics

The Hammond organs are a primitive form of additive synthesis. There are nine sine-waves for each key (or voice) that are fixed in tuning to approximate the lower harmonics of a musical tone (and some sub-harmonics). The controls for the volume of these sine-waves are called drawbars. Mixing the tones in various ratios allows the organ to produce different timbres.

The Hammond uses a color coding to classify the drawbars. While the Hammond uses brown, black, and white we used "Squinky Blue" instead of brown. The drawbars are named after organ "footages", where the length of an organ pipe would determine the pitch. 8' is considered the "fundamental" and is at pitch C4. So the drwabars are, from left to right:

* 16', blue. Sub-octave, "Bourdon". One octave below the fundamental. C3.
* 5 1/3', blue. third harmonic down an octave, "Quint". G4.
* 8', white. fundamental, "Principal". C4.
* 4', white, second harmonic, "Octave". C5.
* 2 2/3', black, "Nazard". Third harmonic. G5.
* 2', white, "Blockfl√∂te". Fourth harmonic, C6.

## Non-Hammond features we added

The major "non Hammond" feature we added are the two knobs to control the attack and release of the envelopes. While this is not at all authentic, it does allow you to approximate the sound of the traditional "swell" pedal. And it allows an expanded palette of sounds without going too far away from the original.

The percussion section is slightly more versatile that the Hammond percussion. A real Hammond has four switches to control percussion: on/off, normal/soft, fast/slow, third/second. Organ four replaces on/off, normal/soft and third/second with the volume controls. One is the volume for the second harmonic, the other is the volume for the third harmonic.

And we did not emulate the way Hammond percussion "steals" tones from the drawbars.

VCO mode. If you do not connect the gate input, Organ-3 will output polyphonic waveforms all the time, like a VCO. Then you most provide your own volume and timbre controls.

CV inputs for the drawbar volumes.

## About the presets

Organ-3 ships with a selection of "factory presets". These can be found on the context menu of Organ-3. These presets mostly come from various internet sources for Hammond organ presets.

We have categorized them by name, so the first word should say what the preset is:

* basics. These are commonly recommended starting points for various genres of pop, rock and jazz.

* songs. These are presets that are supposed to approximate the Hammond sound of various well known Hammond sounds. 

* strings, reeds, etc. These are setting that are supposed to mimic the sounds of other organs. In most cases they sound little like the instruments they are named for, as organs can't really synthesize these instruments well.

## Reference


# old stuff

Note: you must hook up the gate input for sound to come out. This module is a full instrument with its own (simple )envelope generators.

Working:

* 16 voice polyphonic.
* All the normal drawbars.
* Percussion (partially).
* Reasonable CPU usage.

Not working:

* No control of percussion decay time.

Known bugs:

* If any of the harmonics get above 40 k the audio goes insane.

Will do:

* Percussion decay time.
* tune the attack and release to make them faster without clicking.
* probably add some control over "key click". Won't sound exactly like a Hammond though.
* CV control of the drawbars, although probably not polyphonic.
* Probably make some presets.
* Will try to reduce the CPU usage.
* Probably a mode where the internal envelope generators are turned off so it acts like a poly VCO, rather than a synth voice.

Could:

* Add pitch modulation input.
* Add tuning controls and/or pitch modulation CV
* Have other envelopes besides "Hammond" ones.
* Have all the drawbar harmonics available as percussion harmonics, too.
